                <h3>Before you share your idea, a final reminder: </h3> This is a public website where people come
                for ideas. Don't share anything you don't want stolen, riffed on or played with! Below you will be
                asked how to offer the idea - free, partner, or paid. If it's free and you just want to see it made,
                that's great, please describe it fully! If it's paid, give a brief outline of what you want without
                divulging any proprietary information, then let the money do the talking - you get what you pay for.
                If you choose 'partner' and want to negotiate a deal with a coder to make something for less than an
                outright fee, just know that while it's possible, it's both unlikely and risky. Whatever your
                option, meet and verify the people you meet here before becoming invested. Remember how easy it was
                to sign up to this site, and trust people accordingly. The world is full of sailors and loose men.
                You might all be rapscallions for all we know and: <h3>We Take No Responsibility.</h3>
